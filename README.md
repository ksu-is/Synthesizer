# Synthesizer
#Started creating functions that generate wave tables and also some functions that smooth out the sound via interpolation and fade in/out. 
#Can switch between sin wave and a sawtooth wave. Want to look for more formulas for different wave tables. 
#Was able to generate wav files and tune to different notes in the scale of C Major.
