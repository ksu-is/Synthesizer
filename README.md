# Synthesizer
-Log-
7/14 Started creating functions that generate wave tables and also some functions that smooth out the sound via interpolation and fade in/out. 
Can switch between sin wave and a sawtooth wave. Want to look for more formulas for different wave tables. 
Was able to generate .wav files and tune to different notes in the scale of C Major.

--Roadmap Tasks--
Bare Minimum
-Be able to generate a song (something simple such as Mary Had a Little Lamb) via hard coding (currently only generating one signal)
-Be able to change the wavetable to a few different options via hard coding

Additional Tasks
-Look into repositories that have a piano GUI. (Idea-select wavetable, bring up GUI that allows user to play notes via keyboard input)
-Look into repositories that have a GUI for editing variables about the wavetable (ex volume envelope, where the wavetable starts, transposition, etc)
-Add more custom wave tables using formulas (ex square wave, triangle wave, something in between), know how to edit variables to make cool sounds
-Add shortcuts to change the octave up or down (ex c1 up to c5)
-Make turnable knobs (excitement)
-Add effects ( ex delay, echo, flanger, phaser )
